# Crop-disease-detection

We propose to create an application that would classify over 100 flowers and identify different kind of diseases across 5 crops. This application is catered towards Farmers and curious minds who wish to learn more about these, with variety of information.

Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure.
We propose to build an android application that would help the farmers to identify the various species and diseases and also provide with steps they should follow to eradicate them.

Hosting a vivid range of flora in it’s biodiversity, Earth has so much to offer. Often, mankind is introduced to various species of flowers while exploring the wilderness for leisure, medical or monetary research.
We propose to build an android application that would provide a tool for these scenaria, empowering the users with the knowledge and resources for the flowers they come across.

#Existing work with Limitations

There isn’t any optimised application for the farmers to:
Use on their phones
Click an image, uploading it
Getting relevant information for their queries.
Existing work has largely been limited only to:
Iris Flower Species Classification
Inability to cover:
multiple diseases.
Multiple crop species
The models are complicated to understand for Farmers and General Public who are to be educated by this.
The potential of reaching hundreds, if not thousands of farmers using inexpensive 4G internet infrastructure across India, is being untapped.

#Model
Simple Neural Nets are good at learning the weights with one hidden layer which is in between the input and output layer. But, it’s not good at complex feature learning.
On another hand in  Deep Learning Neural Nets, the series of layers between input and output layer are called hidden layers that can perform identification of features and creating new series of features from data, just as our brain. The more layers we push into the more features it will learn and perform complex operations. The output layer combines all features and makes predictions.
Therefore, Simple Neural Nets are used for simple tasks and bulk data isn’t required to train itself. whereas in Deep learning Neural Network can be expensive and require massive data sets to train itself on. 
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN or Conv Nets) is well known for its use in applications of image and video recognition. It is more efficient because it reduces the number of parameters which makes different from other deep learning models.
